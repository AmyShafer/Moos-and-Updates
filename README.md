# Moos and Updates

Woodstock Farm Sanctuary residents have never been known to keep their thoughts and opinions to themselves. Moos and Upodates keeps all the cows, pigs, chickens, goats, sheep, and guinea fowl connected, no matter what native sound they may make!

## Resources Used

I made an error when using GitHub but I was able to self-correct using this StackOverflow article.
[![GitHub Help](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-Hub-grey)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51421420/accidentally-initialised-git-repo-for-my-whole-desktop)

There were hints about what to look up in the comments of the mini project that prefaced this homework assignment. The hints lead me to this information in the MongoDB Docs.
[![Mongo Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Mongo-DB-bright-green)](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/)

I needed to read up on some particulars of Mongoose.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I would like the residents to have links to the appropriate biography page on the Woodstock Farm Sanctuary website.

I would also like to improve the email address function and make the addresses more fun.

## Learn More

From the organization's website,
"Woodstock Farm Sanctuary rescues farmed animals that are often victims of cruelty and neglect. Many of the residents have escaped slaughterhouses, have been rescued from closing farms and auctions, or are surrendered to us. When we say yes to rescuing an animal, we say yes to providing them love and care for the rest of their life."
